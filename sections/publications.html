                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    The shift towards agile microservice architecture has enabled significant benefits for IT companies but has also resulted in increased complexity for Cloud orchestration tools. Traditional tools were designed for centralized data centers and are ineffective for locating microservices in geographically-distributed edge-like infrastructures. This paper presents Phare, a decentralized scheduling algorithm designed to optimize the placement of microservices by satisfying their computing and communication demands while minimizing deployment costs. Phare employs a heuristic-based approach to solve the NP-Hard scheduling problem, prioritizing the microservices with the more stringent requirements and placing them on the most convenient computing facilities, based on the concept of affinity, contributing to the field by providing a more holistic approach to resource scheduling in edge computing. We validate our approach against Firmament, the state-of-the-art workload scheduling algorithm for component-based applications, on simulated edge infrastructures with hundreds of clusters. Phare achieves up to a 10Ã— reduction in terms of deployment costs compared to Firmament while providing a much lower scheduling latency.

                    This paper investigates the application of Kubernetes and Edge computing technologies to operate IT
                    services in the context of power systems and smart grids. Traditional services for grid monitoring
                    such as Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs) require a centralized
                    architecture and a rigid networking infrastructure in order to properly function, which today is
                    only achieved at the High Voltage (HV) transmission level. Furthermore, manual intervention is often
                    the only option for PMUs/PDCs maintenance. In this work, the traditional PMU/PDC services were
                    deployed as docker-containers in a decentralized Kubernetes cluster, which can represent any kind of
                    geographically dispersed TCP/IP network. By leveraging remote orchestration, several key benefits
                    are achieved: (1) no manual reconfiguration of the PMU-PDC communications upon network
                    reconfiguration, (2) automatic PMU traffic redirection in case of PDC service redeployment in a
                    different location, and (3) reduced data-loss upon PDC failure and enhanced overall system
                    resiliency due to minimized ICT services down-time.

                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    The capability to predict the precise resource requirements of a microservice-based application is a
                    very important problem for cloud services. In fact, the allocation of abundant resources guarantees
                    an excellent quality of experience (QoE) for the hosted services, but it can translate into
                    unnecessary costs for the cloud customer due to the reserved (but unused) resources. On the other
                    side, poor resource provisioning may turn out in scarce performance when experiencing an unexpected
                    peak of demand. This paper proposes RAYGO, a novel approach for dynamic resource provisioning to
                    microservices in Kubernetes that (i) reliefs the customers from the definition of appropriate
                    execution boundaries, (ii) ensures the right amount of resources at any time, according to the past
                    and the predicted usage, and (iii) operates at the application level, acknowledging the dependency
                    between multiple correlated microservices.
